    <h2>About the plugin</h2>
    <p class="justify">
		A plugin that helps the developer quickly generate code examples in C# for various well-known Design Patterns. 
        The plugin contains various actions, including generation actions, which generate ready-made projects (the type of each project is a console application) in C# for the Microsoft Visual Studio 
        with example code for the selected design pattern. Each of the generated demo projects shows the use of a specific design pattern in a specific practical example problem and is 
        aimed at helping the developer adapt the ready-made generated example template to any other similar tasks the developer needs in his programs.

    <h2>Description of actions</h2>
    
	<p>Below is a description of how the actions supported by the plugin work.</p>
    
	<h3 id="action_clean_generated_directory">Clear plugin 'generated' directory</h3>
	<p class="justify">
        The action clears the entire contents of the <b>generated</b> directory located inside the plugin directory, thus erasing all previous plugin-generated code examples with design patterns and/or techniques.
    </p>
    
    <a href="#toc" title="To Contents">▲ To Contents</a>

	<h3 id="action_generate_behavioral_visitor_pattern">[Behavioral] Generate 'Visitor' Pattern</h3>
    <p class="justify">
        This action generates an example of a finished project in the <b>generated</b> directory of the plugin, demonstrating the use and application of the 'Visitor' behavioral design pattern. 
        The example generated project will be located in the <b>visitor</b> subdirectory of the <b>generated</b> directory.
    </p>
    <p class="justify">
        In this example, the classes <span class="code">Circle</span>, <span class="code">Square</span>, <span class="code">Triangle</span> and <span class= "code">Rectangle</span> represent 
        various geometric shapes, and the <span class="code">AreaVisitor</span> class implements the <span class="code">IVisitor</span> visitor interface to calculate the area of ​​each shape. 
        The <span class="code">Accept</span> method in each shape class calls the corresponding visitor method to calculate the area of ​​the shape. 
        When you run the program for the project generated by the action, a message will be displayed with the areas of the circle, square, triangle and rectangle, without changing the classes 
        of these shapes themselves. Thus, the 'Visitor' pattern allows you to add new operations on objects without changing the objects themselves.
    </p>

    <a href="#toc" title="To Contents">▲ To Contents</a>

	<h3 id="action_generate_behavioral_chain_of_responsibility_pattern">[Behavioral] Generate 'Chain Of Responsibility' Pattern</h3>
    <p class="justify">
        This action generates an example of a finished project in the <b>generated</b> directory of the plugin, demonstrating the use and application of the 'Chain Of Responsibility' behavioral design pattern. 
        The example generated project will be located in the <b>chain_of_responsibility</b> subdirectory of the <b>generated</b> directory.
    </p>
    <p class="justify">
        The example program generated by the action represents a situation where we have a system for processing loan applications. 
        We have several levels of loan approval, and each level must decide whether to approve the application or pass it on to the next level. 
        In this example, the <span class="code">BankManager</span> and <span class="code">LoanManager</span> classes implement the common <span class="code">ICreditApprover</span> 
        interface and represent different loan approval levels, and the <span class="code">CreditRequest</span> class represents the loan application itself. 
        Each processor decides whether it can approve the request, and if not, passes it on to the next processor in the chain. 
        This is how the 'Chain of Responsibility' pattern is implemented.
    </p>    
    
    <a href="#toc" title="To Contents">▲ To Contents</a>

	<h3 id="action_generate_behavioral_command_pattern">[Behavioral] Generate 'Command' Pattern</h3>
    <p class="justify">
        This action generates an example of a finished project in the <b>generated</b> directory of the plugin, demonstrating the use and application of the behavioral 
        design pattern 'Command'. The example generated project will be located in the <b>command</b> subdirectory of the <b>generated</b> directory.
    </p>
    <p class="justify">
        The action-generated example program represents a situation where we have a robot that can execute various commands, such as moving forward and backward. 
        We can use the 'Command' pattern to manage these commands. In this example, we create a <span class="code">ICommand</span> interface that represents a command. 
        Then we have concrete command classes <span class="code">MoveForwardCommand</span> and <span class="code">MoveBackwardCommand</span> that implement this interface. 
        The <span class="code">Robot</span> class represents the object on which commands are executed. <span class="code">CommandExecutor</span> is responsible for 
        executing commands. The <span class="code">Main</span> method of the example program creates a robot object and commands for moving forward and backward. 
        These commands are then passed to <span class="code">CommandExecutor</span>, which executes them.
    </p>

    <a href="#toc" title="To Contents">▲ To Contents</a>

	<h3 id="action_generate_behavioral_template_method_pattern">[Behavioral] Generate 'Template Method' Pattern</h3>
    <p class="justify">
        This action generates in the <b>generated</b> directory of the plugin an example of a finished project demonstrating the use and application of the behavioral 
        design pattern 'Template Method'. The example generated project will be located in the <b>template_method</b> subdirectory of the <b>generated</b> directory.
    </p>
    <p class="justify">
        The example program generated by the action represents a situation where we have a base class <span class="code">DataProcessor</span> that defines a template 
        for processing data. We also have two subclasses <span class="code">CsvDataProcessor</span> and <span class="code">ExcelDataProcessor</span> that implement 
        specific steps for processing data from CSV and Excel files, respectively. In this example, the abstract class <span class="code">DataProcessor</span> defines 
        a template method <span class="code">ProcessData</span> that invokes a sequence of operations to process the data: reading, parsing, and parsing. 
        The CsvDataProcessor and ExcelDataProcessor subclasses implement the specific steps of these operations according to the file format (CSV or Excel). 
        In the <span class="code">Main</span> method, instances of the <span class="code">CsvDataProcessor</span> and <span class="code">ExcelDataProcessor</span> classes 
        are created, and then the method is called <span class="code">ProcessData</span>, which sequentially performs all data processing steps according to the pattern 
        defined in the base class.
    </p>
    
    <a href="#toc" title="To Contents">▲ To Contents</a>

	<h3 id="action_generate_behavioral_null_object_pattern">[Behavioral] Generate 'Null Object' Pattern</h3>
    <p class="justify">
        This action generates an example of a finished project in the plugin's <b>generated</b> directory, demonstrating the use and application of the Null Object 
        behavioral design pattern. The example generated project will be located in the <b>null_object</b> subdirectory of the <b>generated</b> directory.
    </p>
    <p class="justify">
        The Null Object pattern is used to provide a stub object that implements an interface but does not perform any action. This pattern is useful when you need 
        to avoid null checks and provide safer program behavior. In the example program generated by the action, the option of using the 'Null Object' pattern is 
        considered using the example of logging in an application. We have an <span class="code">ILogger</span> interface that defines a method for writing logs. 
        We will create two classes: <span class="code">FileLogger</span>, which saves logs to a file, and <span class="code">NullLogger</span>, which represents a null 
        object and does not perform any action. In this example, if we use <span class="code">FileLogger</span>, then the logs will be written to a file. However, 
        if we replace <span class="code">FileLogger</span> with <span class="code">NullLogger</span>, then the log writing operations will proceed without errors, 
        but no actual writing will be done. This avoids null checks and ensures smoother program execution.
    </p>
    
    <a href="#toc" title="To Contents">▲ To Contents</a>

	<h3 id="action_generate_behavioral_strategy_pattern">[Behavioral] Generate 'Strategy' Pattern</h3>
    <p class="justify">
        This action generates in the plugin's <b>generated</b> directory an example of a finished project demonstrating the use and application of the 
        'Strategy' behavioral design pattern. The example generated project will be located in the <b>strategy</b> subdirectory of the <b>generated</b> directory.
    </p>
    <p class="justify">
        The Strategy pattern is used to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each of them, and make them interchangeable. In the example program generated by 
        the action, the option of using the 'Strategy' pattern is considered using the example of payment processing in an online store. We have an 
        interface <span class="code">IPaymentStrategy</span>, which defines a method for making a payment, and two specific implementations of this 
        interface: <span class="code">CreditCardPaymentStrategy</span> for payment by credit card and <span class="code">PayPalPaymentStrategy</span> for payment 
        via PayPal. In this example, we are creating two payment processing strategies: credit card payment and PayPal payment. We then create instances 
        of the <span class="code">PaymentProcessor</span> class, passing a specific strategy to each of them. When calling 
        the <span class="code">ProcessOrder</span> method, the <span class="code">PaymentProcessor</span> will execute the appropriate payment algorithm depending 
        on the selected strategy. This makes it easy to add new payment methods without changing the main code and provides system flexibility.
    </p>

	<h3 id="action_generate_behavioral_observer_pattern">[Behavioral] Generate 'Observer' Pattern</h3>
    <p class="justify">
        This action generates an example of a finished project in the plugin's <b>generated</b> directory, demonstrating the use and application of the Observer 
        behavioral design pattern. The example generated project will be located in the <b>strategy</b> subdirectory of the <b>generated</b> directory.
    </p>
    <p class="justify">
        The Observer pattern is used to establish a one-to-many dependency between objects, so that when one object changes, all objects that depend on it are notified 
        and updated automatically. In the example program generated by the action, the option of using the “Observer” pattern is considered using the example of a 
        notification system on a social network. We have a <span class="code">ISubscriber</span> interface that defines a method for updating subscribers, 
        and a <span class="code">SocialMediaPage</span> class that represents a page on a social network and notifies its subscribers about new posts. 
        In this example, the <span class="code">SocialMediaPage</span> class represents a page on a social network that can have multiple followers. 
        When a new post appears on the page, the <span class="code">PostNewContent</span> method notifies all subscribers about the new content by calling 
        the <span class="code">Update</span> method on each subscriber. When you run the program, two subscribers are created and added to your social network page. 
        Two posts are then created and each subscriber receives a notification of the new post. After this, one of the subscribers is deleted, and only one subscriber 
        will receive a notification about the last post.
    </p>

	<h3 id="action_generate_behavioral_state_pattern">[Behavioral] Generate 'State' Pattern</h3>
    <p class="justify">
        This action generates an example of a finished project in the plugin's <b>generated</b> directory, demonstrating the use and application of the State behavioral 
        design pattern. The example generated project will be located in the <b>state</b> subdirectory of the <b>generated</b> directory.
    </p>
    <p class="justify">
        The example program generated by the action simulates the following situation. Let's imagine an order management system for an online store. 
        In this system, an order can be in different states, such as "new", "processing", "shipped" and "delivered". We can use the State pattern to model these 
        different states and how an order behaves depending on its current state. In this example, we create a <span class="code">IOrderState</span> interface 
        that defines methods for processing and canceling an order. We then create classes that represent the specific states of the order: New, Processing, and Canceled. 
        The <span class="code">Order</span> class uses the current state to perform appropriate operations. When we run the program, we create an order, move it to the 
        "Processing" state, try to reprocess the order, cancel the order, and try to process the canceled order. As a result, we see that the order's behavior 
        changes depending on its current state, which is the main principle of the 'State' pattern.
    </p>

	<h3 id="action_generate_behavioral_memento_pattern">[Behavioral] Generate 'Memento' Pattern</h3>
    <p class="justify">
        This action generates an example of a finished project in the <b>generated</b> directory of the plugin, demonstrating the use and application of the behavioral 
        design pattern 'Guardian' (Memento). The example generated project will be located in the <b>memento</b> subdirectory of the <b>generated</b> directory.
    </p>
    <p class="justify">
        The example program generated by the action simulates the following situation. Let's imagine that we are developing a text editor that needs to have undo/redo 
        functionality. We can use the Memento pattern to save the state of a text editor and its change history. In this example, we have 
        a <span class="code">TextDocument</span> class that represents a text document. It has methods for updating text, canceling (Undo) and returning (Redo) changes. 
        The <span class="code">Save</span> method saves the current state of the text as a <span class="code">TextDocumentMemento</span> object, which is added to 
        the <span class="code">_mementos</span> stack. When you start the program, a text document is created, its text is changed, then the changes are canceled 
        and returned to the previous state. This demonstrates the use of the Memento pattern to save and restore the state of an object.
    </p>

	<h3 id="action_generate_behavioral_mediator_pattern">[Behavioral] Generate 'Mediator' Pattern</h3>
    <p class="justify">
        This action generates an example of a finished project in the <b>generated</b> directory of the plugin, demonstrating the use and application of the behavioral 
        design pattern 'Mediator' (Mediator). The generated example project will be located in the <b>mediator</b> subdirectory of the <b>generated</b> directory.
    </p>
    <p class="justify">
        The example program generated by the action simulates the following situation. Let's say we have a flight management system, where various components may be 
        involved, such as a ticketing agency, an airline, a reservation system, etc. We can use the Mediator pattern to coordinate the interactions between these components. 
        In this example, the <span class="code">AirTrafficControl</span> class acts as an intermediary that registers participants and coordinates the exchange of messages 
        between them. Participants (for example, "Airline", "Reservation Engine", "Ticket Agency") can send messages through an intermediary, and it will transmit messages 
        to other participants. The example demonstrates the implementation of a typical task for the interaction of various components in a flight control system.

	<h3 id="action_generate_behavioral_iterator_pattern">[Behavioral] Generate 'Iterator' Pattern</h3>
    <p class="justify">
        This action generates in the plugin's <b>generated</b> directory an example of a finished project demonstrating the use and application of the Iterator 
        behavioral design pattern. The example generated project will be located in the <b>iterator</b> subdirectory of the <b>generated</b> directory.
    </p>
    <p class="justify">
        The example program generated by the action simulates the following situation. Let's say we have a <span class="code">Student</span> class and 
        a <span class="code">StudentCollection</span> class that implements the <span class="code">IEnumerable{T}</span> interface to iterate over students. 
        In this example, <span class="code">StudentCollection</span> represents a collection of students, and <span class="code">StudentIterator</span> implements an 
        iterator for that collection. By using a <span class="code">foreach</span> loop over a <span class="code">studentCollection</span> object, we can iterate over all 
        the students in the collection without needing to know the iteration implementation details. The example demonstrates the implementation of a typical task for 
        developers when it is necessary to iterate over elements in a collection using an iterator.

	<h3 id="action_generate_creational_abstract_factory_pattern">[Creational] Generate 'Abstract Factory' Pattern</h3>
    <p class="justify">
        This action generates an example of a finished project in the <b>generated</b> directory of the plugin, demonstrating the use and application of the creational 
        design pattern 'Abstract Factory'. The example generated project will be located in the <b>abstract_factory</b> subdirectory of the <b>generated</b> directory.
    </p>
    <p class="justify">
        The example generated by the action simulates a situation where we need to produce parts for cars of different classes - sports cars and sedans. 
        The <span class="code">AbstractCarFactory</span> class establishes a contract (available class methods) for the production of spare parts for cars of a given class. 
        The factory class is able to produce certain types of engines and bodies for cars. The classes of specific factories <span class="code">SedanV4CarFactory</span> 
        and <span class="code">SportCarV12CarFactory</span> are responsible for the production of parts for a car of a given type: the first - parts for sedans, 
        the second - parts for sports cars. To obtain an instance of a specific factory, just call the static method <span class="code">AbstractCarFactory.GetFactory{T}</span> 
        on the abstract factory class and pass it the required type of a specific factory, and then create parts of a specific type using the resulting instance.

	<h3 id="action_generate_creational_builder_pattern">[Creational] Generate 'Builder' Pattern</h3>
    <p class="justify">
        This action generates an example of a finished project in the plugin's <b>generated</b> directory, demonstrating the use and application of the 'Builder' 
        creational design pattern. The example generated project will be located in the <b>builder</b> subdirectory of the <b>generated</b> directory.
    </p>
    <p class="justify">
        In this example, the <span class="code">PizzaOrder</span> class represents a pizza order, and the <span class="code">IPizzaBuilder</span> interface defines 
        methods for setting the pizza size and adding toppings to the pizza order. The <span class="code">MargheritaPizzaBuilder</span> class implements 
        the <span class="code">IPizzaBuilder</span> interface for creating a Margherita pizza order. The <span class="code">PizzaDirector</span> manages the 
        pizza order assembly process. When you run the program, an order of Margherita pizza is created with the specified size and toppings, after which it is 
        displayed on the console.

	<h3 id="action_generate_creational_factory_method_pattern">[Creational] Generate 'Factory Method' Pattern</h3>
    <p class="justify">
        This action generates an example of a finished project in the <b>generated</b> directory of the plugin, demonstrating the use and application of the creational 
        design pattern 'Factory Method'. The example generated project will be located in the <b>factory_method</b> subdirectory of the <b>generated</b> directory.
    </p>
    <p class="justify">
        The action-generated example program shows sample C# code that demonstrates the use of the Factory Method generative pattern to create objects that represent 
        different types of vehicles (eg, car, bicycle, airplane). In this example, the classes <span class="code">Car</span>, <span class="code">Bicycle</span>, 
        and <span class="code">Airplane</span> represent different types of vehicles, implementing the <span class="code">ITransport</span> interface. 
        Factory classes (<span class="code">CarFactory</span>, <span class="code">BicycleFactory</span>, <span class="code">AirplaneFactory</span>) implement the 
        abstract method <span class="code">TransportFactory.CreateTransport</span>, which returns a specific instance of the corresponding vehicle. 
        When the program starts, instances of various vehicle types are created using the appropriate factories, after which they are used to perform 
        the <span class="code">ITransport.Drive</span> action.

	<h3 id="action_generate_creational_not_thread_safe_singleton_pattern">[Creational] Generate 'Singleton' Pattern - not thread-safe</h3>
    <p class="justify">
        This action generates an example of a finished project in the plugin's <b>generated</b> directory, demonstrating the use and application of the Singleton 
        creational design pattern, which is not thread-safe. The generated example project will be located in the <b>not_thread_safe_singleton</b> subdirectory of 
        the <b>generated</b> directory.
    </p>
    <p class="justify">
        In this example, the <span class="code">Logger</span> class is a simple logger that uses the Singleton pattern to ensure that we only have one instance of 
        the logger in the application. The <span class="code">Logger.GetInstance</span> method returns this single instance, and all calls 
        to <span class="code">Logger.GetInstance()</span> will return a reference to the same object class <span class="code">Logger</span>. 
        The example implementation of the 'Singleton' pattern is not thread-safe, i.e. in the case of a multi-threaded application and the possibility of different 
        threads accessing the <span class="code">Logger.GetInstance</span> method, the program may behave incorrectly, and different threads will create different 
        instances of the singleton class, which is not expected from the behavior of the program. Therefore, this implementation option can only be used when only one 
        thread at a time requests an instance of the <span class="code">Logger</span> class. This Singleton approach is useful, for example, for creating a global logger 
        or accessing shared resources that only one object in the application should have access to.

	<h3 id="action_generate_creational_thread_safe_singleton_pattern">[Creational] Generate 'Singleton' Pattern - thread-safe</h3>
    <p class="justify">
        This action generates in the plugin's <b>generated</b> directory an example of a finished project demonstrating the use and application of the Singleton 
        creational design pattern, which is thread safe. The generated example project will be located in the <b>thread_safe_singleton</b> subdirectory of the <b>generated</b> directory.
    </p>
    <p class="justify">
        In this example, the <span class="code">Logger</span> class is a simple logger that uses the Singleton pattern to ensure that we only have one instance of the 
        logger in the application. The public <span class="code">Logger.Instance</span> property returns this single instance, and all calls 
        to <span class="code">Logger.Instance</span> will return a reference to the same class object <span class="code">Logger</span>. 
        This implementation of the 'Singleton' pattern is thread-safe, although it reduces the performance of the variant due to additional locking inside 
        the <span class="code">Logger.Instance</span> property, which is necessary to synchronize threads when obtaining a single instance of a singleton class. 
        This Singleton approach is useful, for example, for creating a global logger or accessing shared resources that only one object in the application should 
        have access to.

	<h3 id="action_generate_creational_object_pool_pattern">[Creational] Generate 'Object Pool' Pattern</h3>
    <p class="justify">
        This action generates an example of a finished project in the <b>generated</b> directory of the plugin, demonstrating the use and application of the creational 
        Object Pool design pattern. The example generated project will be located in the <b>object_pool</b> subdirectory of the <b>generated</b> directory.
    </p>
    <p class="justify">
        The example shows a simple implementation of the 'Object Pool' pattern in C#, which models a pool of database connections. 
        In this example, <span class="code">ConnectionPool</span> represents a pool of <span class="code">DatabaseConnection</span> objects that are intended to work 
        with a database. When requesting a connection from the pool, it either returns an existing connection or creates a new one if all connections are already taken. 
        Once used, the connection can be released back into the pool for reuse. The Object Pool pattern is useful when creating and destroying objects are expensive 
        operations and reusing them can improve application performance.

    <p class="justify">
        This action generates an example of a finished project in the <b>generated</b> directory of the plugin, demonstrating the use and application of the creational 
        design pattern 'Prototype'. An example of the generated project will be located in the <b>prototype</b> subdirectory of the <b>generated</b> directory.
    </p>
    <p class="justify">
        The example program generated by the action represents a situation where we have a system for creating and editing documents, and we need to implement the ability 
        to clone an existing document to create a new one. In this example, <span class="code">Document</span> represents a concrete document class that implements 
        the <span class="code">DocumentPrototype.Clone</span> method, which returns a clone of the current object. When creating a cloned document, we can change its 
        title without affecting the original document. The Prototype pattern is useful when you need to create objects based on existing objects with minimal changes. 
        This avoids complex operations of creating new objects from scratch.

    <p class="justify">
        This action generates an example of a finished project in the <b>generated</b> directory of the plugin, demonstrating the use and application of the 'Adapter' 
        structural design pattern. The example generated project will be located in the <b>adapter</b> subdirectory of the <b>generated</b> directory.
    </p>
    <p class="justify">
        The action-generated sample program provides sample C# code that demonstrates the use of the Adapter pattern to convert the interface of one class to the 
        interface of another class. As an example, we take a situation where we have a third-party library that provides functionality for working with various input 
        devices, and we want to use this library in our project, but we already have our own interface for working with input devices. 
        In this example, the <span class="code">ThirdPartyInputDevice</span> class represents a third-party library, <span class="code">IInputDevice</span> represents 
        an interface in our project, and <span class="code">InputDeviceAdapter</span> is an adapter that allows you to use the functionality of a third-party library 
        through our interface. The adapter allows us to encapsulate the logic for converting method calls from our interface into calls to methods of a third-party library.

    <p class="justify">
        The example program generated by the action shows an example of using the Bridge pattern in C# to create various types of devices and their control panels. 
        The Bridge pattern allows you to separate an abstraction from its implementation so that they can change independently of each other. 
        In this example, we create an abstract class <span class="code">RemoteControl</span> that represents a remote control for a device. 
        We have two specific devices: <span class="code">TV</span> and <span class="code">Radio</span> that implement the <span class="code">IDevice</span> interface.

        structural design pattern. The example generated project will be located in the <b>decorator</b> subdirectory of the <b>generated</b> directory.
    </p>
    <p class="justify">
        The example program generated by the action shows an example of using the Decorator pattern in C# to create a system for managing user access rights. 
        In this example, we will be adding different levels of access to the underlying user object. In this example, <span class="code">IUser</span> represents 
        the interface for the underlying user object. The <span class="code">User</span> class represents the base user. The <span class="code">AdminUserDecorator</span> 
        and <span class="code">ModeratorUserDecorator</span> decorators add appropriate access levels to the user. The Decorator pattern allows you to dynamically add 
        new functionality or change the behavior of an object without changing its underlying structure. When you run the program, you can see how each user is displayed 
        based on their access level (administrator or moderator) added through decorators.

    <p class="justify">
        The example program generated by the action provides an example implementation of the 'Linker' pattern in C# using the task of organizing files and folders. 
        In this example, the <span class="code">File</span> and <span class="code">Folder</span> classes represent files and folders, respectively, and inherit from 
        the abstract class <span class="code">FileSystemItem </span>. The abstract class <span class="code">FileSystemItem</span> defines common methods and properties 
        for files and folders. The <span class="code">Folder</span> class can contain both files and other folders. 
        The <span class="code">FileSystemItem.Print</span> method is called recursively for each element, which allows you to display the structure of the file system, 
        taking into account nested elements.

    <p class="justify">
        The example program generated by the action presents a test situation using the task of creating web pages. 
        In this example, the class <span class="code">WebPage</span> represents the web page, the interface <span class="code">IWebPage</span> represents the opportunist 
        interface. The <span class="code">WebPageFactory</span> class is a worker factory and is responsible for creating and managing <span class="code">WebPage</span> 
        instances. If a web page with the given content already exists, the factory returns the previously created instance, otherwise it creates a new instance and 
        stores it for later use. When you call the <span class="code">IWebPage.Display</span> method, each web page is displayed with the specified theme. 
        Web pages with the same content are reused, saving memory and reducing the number of objects created.

        structural design pattern. The example generated project will be located in the <b>proxy</b> subdirectory of the <b>generated</b> directory.
    </p>
    <p class="justify">
        The example program generated by the action represents a situation where y has a class that represents downloading images from the network. 
        We can use the Proxy pattern to implement caching of downloaded images to reduce the number of requests to the server. 
        In this example, <span class="code">ImageService</span> is the actual image download service, and <span class="code">ImageProxy</span> is a proxy that checks 
        for the image to be cached before downloading it from the network. If the image is already downloaded and is in the cache, the proxy returns it from the cache, 
        otherwise it delegates the request to the real download service. When you run the program, you can see that if you download the same image again, 
        it will be retrieved from the cache, which helps reduce the number of requests to the server and improve performance.

    <p class="justify">
        The example program generated by the action presents a situation where you need to implement a simple router for a web application. 
        We can use the Router pattern to map URLs to specific request handlers. In this example, the <span class="code">Router</span> class maps URLs to the corresponding 
        controllers (represented by the <span class="code">HomeController</span> and <span class="code">AboutController</span> classes). 
        When you call the <span class="code">Router.RouteRequest</span> method with a specific URL, the router checks for the presence of a corresponding controller 
        and calls the <span class="code">Index</span> method of that controller to process the request. When you run the example program, you can see how the router routes requests 
        to different controllers depending on the specified URL.

    <p class="justify">
        The Façade structural pattern allows you to provide a unified interface to a group of subsystem interfaces. 
        The action-generated example provides sample C# code that demonstrates the use of the Facade pattern to work with different kinds of files in the file system. 
        The <span class="code">FileFacade</span> class provides a simplified interface for working with text files and images, hiding the complexity of interacting 
        with the corresponding <span class="code">TextFileHandler</span> and <span class="code">ImageFileHandler</span> subsystems.

	<h3 id="action_generate_technique_cascading_method">[Tecnhiques] Generate the example project for the technology 'Cascading Method' (Cascading Method)</h3>
    <p class="justify">
        This action generates in the <b>generated</b> directory of the plugin an example of a finished project demonstrating the use and application of the 
        Cascading Method technique. The example generated project will be located in the <b>cascading_method</b> subdirectory of the <b>generated</b> directory.
    </p>
    <p class="justify">
        This example simulates a situation where there is an employee class <span class="code">Employee</span> that describes some employee. 
        An employee has the properties <span class="code">FullName</span>, <span class="code">Age</span>, <span class="code">Department</span> and 
        <span class= "code">Position</span>, which stores the full name of the employee, his age, the department in which the employee works and his position. 
        In the <span class="code">Main</span> method of the example test program, we create three objects of the <span class="code">Employee</span> class by using the 
        'Cascade Method' technique, in which the class contains methods <span class="code">WithFullName</span>, <span class="code">WithAge</span>, 
        <span class="code">WithDepartment</span> and <span class="code" >WithPosition</span>, each of which also returns a reference to an instance of 
        the <span class="code">Employee</span> class. This allows, instead of supporting many of all the necessary constructor variations for a class, 
        to support only those necessary - for initializing the main fields/properties of the class, for example, <span class="code">FullName</span> and 
        <span class="code">Age</span>. And we can initialize auxiliary fields/properties of the class as follows: in any order, call the special methods described 
        above in a cascade manner, the return data type of which is <span class="code">Employee</span>. In the "Cascade Method" technique, the expression 
        <span class="code">a.b().c().d()</span> for any of the methods <span class="code">b()</span>, <span class="code">c()</span>, <span class="code">d()</span> 
        always casts the value returned by each method to the type on the left side, i.e. to type <span class="code">a</span>. 
        This allows you to “chain” methods in any order, forming a chain of calls from them that sequentially performs some actions or modifies (as in this example) 
        the instance of the class to which the chain of calls is applied.
